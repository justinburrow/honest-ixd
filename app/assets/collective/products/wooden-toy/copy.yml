  html: "\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve been long-time fans of manny and simon’s modern yet nostalgic wooden toys. We first met up with co-founder Eden in New York and knew instantly we wanted to work on a fun collaboration that brought the best of both brands to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a cue from their clean and simple design, we crafted a set of safari animals that even us big kids wanted in our homes. We worked meticulously together on crafting a color palate that was both fun and beautiful, with hand-painted accents for an extra special touch to delight parents and toddlers alike. </p>"
