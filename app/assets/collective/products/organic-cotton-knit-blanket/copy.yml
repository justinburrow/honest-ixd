  html: "<p>Vanessa Bartko Huynh’s unique aesthetic stems from the anything‐but‐ordinary life she’s lived. American-born Vanessa spent the majority of her childhood in London. After earning a degree in interior design and working for a boutique architecture firm, she found her niche as a handbag and accessories designer for big brands Banana Republic and Michael Kors. Motherhood inspired her search for stylish, youthful bedding and a passion for organic cotton fabrics leading to the launch of Honeyami in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honeyami is a moniker that pays tribute to her married surname — the American pronunciation of Huynh is like the ‘hon’ in honey, which also has been the nickname for her husband and two boys. It’s also a made-up word, unique to her brand and a perfect fit for Honeyami’s one‐of‐a‐kind memorable designs. Honeyami creates organic cotton bedding for the style‐conscious home that nurtures a child’s creative, playful spirit.</p>"
