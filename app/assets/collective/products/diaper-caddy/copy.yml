  html: "<p>Necessity is the mother of all invention as they say. Well for two Australian mums, they turned this philosophy into a global business. Close friends Dannielle Michaels and Monique Filer knew when they became parents their previous 24/7 corporate careers were not conducive to the lifestyle they wanted. But they also knew they needed to put their creativity and business acumen to work. They founded b.box 5 years ago with the goal of providing practical and stylish everyday baby essentials using healthy, safe, and eco-friendly materials — exactly what every parent wants.</p>"
