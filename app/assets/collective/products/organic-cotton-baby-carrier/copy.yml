  html: "\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher connected with fellow entrepreneur and parent Gabby with the goal of creating a carrier that utilized Beco’s proven success with a touch of Honest style and health standards. We visited Gabby and her team in their Southern California design studio mapping out each piece of the collaboration — the fabrics, colors, the contrast stitching, packaging, safety requirements, the subtle butterfly accent — and created a carrier that marries the like-minded thinking of both brands in a way we hope parents will love. </p>"

Never perform any task that could be dangerous with your child in the Beco Baby Carrier. Use common sense! Always double check that the buckles are connected properly. Never unbuckle the waist belt while the baby is in the carrier. By purchasing this product, you acknowledge that the Manufacturer or Distributor accepts no responsibility for injury/damage due to the use/misuse of this product. Your child's safety is your responsibility. Be sure you have help getting your baby into and out of the Beco Baby Carrier until you become comfortable with it. If you are starting out with babywearing, do so over a soft surface such as a bed, sofa, or carpeted floor covered with a blanket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please observe the following while wearing your baby:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please support your baby with a hand or two while you and your baby are getting used to the carrier. You and your baby will become more comfortable in time and you'll be able to free one or both of your hands. Please, DON'T GIVE UP! Babywearing takes practice just like all other parenting tasks. You can make the process easier by making sure that baby is fed, rested, and happy before you try the carrier the first few times. Also, be sure to pull the top rim of fabric up to cover the entire back of your baby to avoid a \"backdive.\" Never wear your baby when cycling or riding in the car. While cooking at the stove, use only back carry position. A carrier doesn't substitute for a car seat. When bending, please bend at the knees, not at the waist, and hold the baby with one hand while reaching with the other. Never drink HOT beverages when wearing baby, although your carrier will come handy for eating, especially in restaurants.</p>"
